    <h1>MSMC</h1>
    <p>
      MSMC is a lightweight library for authenticating with Microsoft for the
      sole intention of launching Minecraft.
    </p>

    <h1>Features:</h1>
    <h2>Tokenless</h2>
    <img src="./assets/Tokenless.png" />
    <p>
      MSMC can make use of and includes the default Mojang auth token. While you
      can define a custom token, with msmc that is an option and not a must.
      Easily get your players online now without worrying about the paperwork.
    </p>
    <h2>Lexipacks!</h2>
    <img src="./assets/Lexipacks.png" />
    <p>
      Tarketing a market that doesn't speak English. While with the json files
      in our Github repo, you can easily change out the language MSMC displays
      in. Whether that be French, Afrikaans, German or Turkish. If we don't have
      a lexipack for you language of choice, then don't worry. It is easy to
      write your own as well.
    </p>

    <h2>Support for multiple frameworks!</h2>
    <img src="./assets/frameworks.png" />
    <p>
      Whether it is Electron, NW.js or you're trying to make a terminal based
      launcher with a standalone version of NodeJS for one reason or another.
      MSMC has your back! Shipping with support for all three scenarios! Do note
      that if you use the raw framework that the end user will need at least
      chrome or the new Microsoft edge on Windows, a chromium based browser
      installed on mac and a display server on Linux with Firefox or Waterfox.
    </p>
    <h2>Xbox Live Integration</h2>
    <img src="./assets/xbox.png" />
    <p>
      While msmc doesn't include a full reimplementation of the Xbox live api.
      We do include enough to get user profiles as well as the friend-lists of a
      set user. You can use this to build an interactive launcher that can
      notify you when your user's friends are online. Custom client creators
      could even go a step further and potentially use this to setup a one click
      join system. MSMC's Social module can run independently meaning you can
      even potentially run it seperately on a remote server!
    </p>
    <h2>Fine controll over refreshes and Logins</h2>
    <img src="./assets/fine controll.png" />
    <p>
      Notice how other launchers can take up to a minute to get everything
      refreshed? Now with msmc you can space out parts of the authentication
      process. Allowing your launcher to feel way more responsive by spacing out
      the calls between logging onto Xbox and getting the Minecraft token needed
      to launch the game! By default it can even check if tokens even need to be
      refreshed!<br />
      (Assuming the launcher hasn't been closed and reopened)
